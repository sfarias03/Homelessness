# Homelessness

In our project, we will use data science methodology to study homelessness in the United States. Our motivation comes from the HUD study's goals of understanding the key factors that contribute to homelessness at the community level. HUD's objectives are: (1) to identify market factors that have a significant impact on homelessness, and (2) to create and evaluate empirical models that can accurately represent and predict homelessness in communities. We will explore if there are better modeling approaches than those described in the HUD report. Our project aims to provide valuable insights to support ongoing efforts to end and prevent homelessness in the U.S.

The data for this project are described in HUDâ€™s report [Market Predictors of Homelessness](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf)
