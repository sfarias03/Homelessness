# Homelessness

In our project, we will use data science methodology to study homelessness in the United States. Our motivation comes from the HUD study's goals of understanding the key factors that contribute to homelessness at the community level. HUD's objectives are: (1) to identify market factors that have a significant impact on homelessness, and (2) to create and evaluate empirical models that can accurately represent and predict homelessness in communities. We will explore if there are better modeling approaches than those described in the HUD report. Our project aims to provide valuable insights to support ongoing efforts to end and prevent homelessness in the U.S.

The data for this project are described in HUDâ€™s report [Market Predictors of Homelessness](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf)  

In preparing our data, we undertook several essential steps. Firstly, we provided a comprehensive description of the data source, including relevant links to access the data whenever possible. Secondly, we carefully inspected the contents of each data set to gain a thorough understanding of their structure and contents. If needed, we performed data type conversions to ensure the columns were in the appropriate formats. To ensure data cleanliness, we removed any unnecessary parts from the data sets, such as duplicate entries or out-of-range values. From the available columns, we selected a subset that would serve as predictors in our analysis, omitting those that were not required. We also addressed missing values by either imputing them or removing rows with NaN values, depending on the situation. To conform to best practices, we organized the data frame in a tidy or long format. Additionally, if necessary, we renamed columns to adhere to conventions of lowercase, snake_case naming that is easily understandable. Finally, we created derived variables that would provide valuable insights for our analysis. These steps ensured that our data was appropriately prepared and ready for further analysis.
